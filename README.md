### Why made me create this app?

This is my portfolio! I was an airline mechanical engineer and now I am going to change my career from the airline industry to the tech world. I couldn't imagine that I became to be able to build web applications by myself (of course, sometimes had my friend and teacher's help and advice)! I believe I put all I learned into this portfolio. Now I am ready to find a job!

### What was challenging?

Day by day, I learn new things and useful things. Eventually, I find my favorite spec to use such as Tailwindcss. They are super easy and user-friendly. However, I decided to use SASS for writing all code by myself for this project. Since the project is bigger than before, it was tough than I imagined. It was nice to control a small adjustment of design. But it was challenging that I need to set all small tiny designs. But I enjoyed it! 

### Goals for Improvement

Sometimes, I ask around what you think about this portfolio and receive some feedback from people. It is very interesting that what we see, find, or experience from one same thing is totally different. What I add something I thought good doesn't work same to others. So now I have many on the list to improve, change, or add to my portfolio. Soon or later, it will be updated!
